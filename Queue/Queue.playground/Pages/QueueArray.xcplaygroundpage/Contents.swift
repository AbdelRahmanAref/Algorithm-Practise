// Challenge 1: Explain the difference between the Stack and Queue

/// The Stack LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure. The Stack is used to restrict the way
/// in which we can interact with data. Using Stacks, we're only allowed to pop the top value
/// off the stack and push values to the top of the stack. If we want to grab one of the values
/// at the bottom of the stack we have to unwind the stack until the desired value is found

/// Examples of stacks: Pancakes, Plates

/// The Queue: FIFO (First In First Out) data structure. The Queue is used to maintain a specific
/// ordering of values. We're only allowed to remove the first value in a queue and append to the
/// end of a queue.

/// Examples of queues: Lines for amusement park rides.
